# Day Of Week GUI
Developed in Java, this program allows users to find out and know what day of the week a specific date was.
>For example: what day of the week were you born? or what day of the week was September 11, 2001?
- The user can select the month, day and type the year in the blank text field and then press the day of the week button to receive a message with the day of the week that corresponds to that date.
- The user will receive an alert message if he/she presses the day of the week button and leaves the year text field empty.
- The program knows that the month of February is a leap year and every 4 years its total number of days changes. This year it had 29 days, next year it will have 28 days until the year 2028 where it will have 29 days again.
  
## To-do list: 
- Change appearances and add logo.
- Display historical images when a historical date is entered.

**Developed using Eclipse IDE.**
